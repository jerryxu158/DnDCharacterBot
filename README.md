# DnDCharacterBot
Hi, This is a simple bot that is designed to help you run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign through discord. The file, main.py, is the raw python used to create the bot. 
Certain parts, such as the SQL code is not shown for security reasons. If you would like to use this code, you will have to write SQL either in stored procedures or raw into the file itself.
As of the current moment, I am not planning on uploading the stored procedures. To run the code, you would also need to input a valid connection string to the databse of your choice
as well as a valid discord bot token.
